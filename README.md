# Deco Tracker v1.64
Deco Tracker is a tool for keeping tabs on which decorations you've collected in the mobile game 'Pikmin Bloom.' It's written with TypeScript and was bootstrapped with Create React App. A special thanks goes to M & J for beta testing and suggesting new features!

*Deco Tracker was made by @kappanjoe as a fan project, and is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Pikmin Bloom, Nintendo, or Niantic or any of their respective subsidiaries or affliates.*

## Features
- Track every decoration you've registered, including variations not counted by the game (such as the hanafuda card designs or shiny chef hats)
- Count the total number of decorations you've registered, with or without including each variation (game-based count does not include variations)
- Choose between Light Mode or Dark Mode, or use your device's system default
- Import/Export your saved data for sharing or transferring between browsers/devices
- Display a reference guide for easier distinction between colors

## How to Use

1. Visit [Deco Tracker web app](https://kappanjoe.github.io/seedling-tracker/)
2. Check the corresponding colored boxes for the decorations you've collected.
3. Collect all the decorations! :D

**Note:** JavaScript must be enabled in your browser. Your collection status will auto-save every time you check or uncheck a box. Wiping your browser's local storage will delete the saved information.
